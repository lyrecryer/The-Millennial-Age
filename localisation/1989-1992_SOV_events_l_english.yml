 sov_fall.2.desc:0 "In 1988, the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania began to organise a Popular Front against the Soviet Union. Thanks to Gorbachev replacing the leaders of the Baltic states with more liberal ones the desire of independence began to grow. On October 6, 1988, Lativa legalized the flying of the pre-Soviet controlled Lativa and made Latvian the official language instead of Russian. In the same month, the Lithuanian government allowed their pre-Soviet controlled flag to be flown and even reinstated the former national anthem. On November 16, 1988, the Supreme Soviet of the Estonian SSR adopted a declaration of national sovereignty under which Estonian laws would take precedence over those of the Soviet Union."

 sov_fall.3.desc:0 "On February 20, 1988, after a week of growing demonstrations in Stepanakert, capital of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast (the Armenian majority area within the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic), the Regional Soviet voted to secede and join with the Soviet Socialist Republic of Armenia. This quickly leads to something known as the Askeran Clash where Azberajijanis and Armenians clashed due to rumours of the murder of an Azerbaijani. What followed is the Sumgait Pogrom on February 26 to March 1, 1988, ending with Soviet troops entering the town. Both Azerbaijani and Armenian leaders were sacked. Starting in July 1988, The Popular Front of Azerbaijan began to demand the same freedoms as the Baltic States. On May 28, the Armenian government allowed the flying of the pre-Soviet controlled flag. On September 17, a gun battle quickly turned into a tit for tat expulsion of each other populations in various towns and cites. Soon it reached its peak on November 17, 1988, with mass demonstrations in Baku lasting 18 days attracting half a million demonstrators. On December 5, 1988, the Soviet militia moved in, cleared the square by force, and imposed a curfew that lasted ten months. Meanwhile, in Georgia, many demonstrators camped out in front of the republic's legislature in November 1988 calling for Georgia's independence and in support of Estonia's declaration of sovereignty."
