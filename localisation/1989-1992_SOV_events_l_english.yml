 sov_fall.1.desc:0 "The report is shockingly grim. The Oil Glut in the early 1980s has crashed our economy. Basic goods are rare and a growing discontent towards the Union. The reforms helped keep us alive but only for a short while. Hardliners in the state are starting to become rebellious and rumours abound of a possible coup being planned."
 sov_fall.2.title:0 "Rise of the Baltic Popular Front"
 sov_fall.2.desc:0 "In 1988, the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania began to organise a Popular Front against the Soviet Union. Thanks to Gorbachev replacing the leaders of the Baltic states with more liberal ones the desire of independence began to grow. On October 6, 1988, Lativa legalized the flying of the pre-Soviet controlled Lativa and made Latvian the official language instead of Russian. In the same month, the Lithuanian government allowed their pre-Soviet controlled flag to be flown and even reinstated the former national anthem. On November 16, 1988, the Supreme Soviet of the Estonian SSR adopted a declaration of national sovereignty under which Estonian laws would take precedence over those of the Soviet Union."
 sov_fall.3.title:0 "Rebellion in the Caucasus"
 sov_fall.3.desc:0 "On February 20, 1988, after a week of growing demonstrations in Stepanakert, capital of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast (the Armenian majority area within the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic), the Regional Soviet voted to secede and join with the Soviet Socialist Republic of Armenia. This quickly leads to something known as the Askeran Clash where Azberajijanis and Armenians clashed due to rumours of the murder of an Azerbaijani. What followed is the Sumgait Pogrom on February 26 to March 1, 1988, ending with Soviet troops entering the town. Both Azerbaijani and Armenian leaders were sacked. Starting in July 1988, The Popular Front of Azerbaijan began to demand the same freedoms as the Baltic States. On May 28, the Armenian government allowed the flying of the pre-Soviet controlled flag. On September 17, a gun battle quickly turned into a tit for tat expulsion of each other populations in various towns and cites. Soon it reached its peak on November 17, 1988, with mass demonstrations in Baku lasting 18 days attracting half a million demonstrators. On December 5, 1988, the Soviet militia moved in, cleared the square by force, and imposed a curfew that lasted ten months. Meanwhile, in Georgia, many demonstrators camped out in front of the republic's legislature in November 1988 calling for Georgia's independence and in support of Estonia's declaration of sovereignty."
 sov_fall.4.title:0 "The Crumbling Iron Curtain: Poland"
 sov_fall.4.desc:0 "In Poland, the trade union called Solidarity is growing in power and started a large scale strike campaign to force the government to give a free election. The ruling communist/military establishment slowly and gradually came to realize that a deal of some sort with the opposition would eventually be necessary and would have to include the leading Solidarity figures. Although Solidarity was crushed under the heel of the regime in the early '80s, the union ideas continued to grow until it became a mass movement too large to stop. Now that regime started to engage in preliminary talks with the movement, it seems that Solidarity is going to be legitimized and possibly take over Poland."
 sov_fall.5.title:0 "The Crumbling Iron Curtain: Hungary"
 sov_fall.5.desc:0 "After the New Economic Mechanism was introduced in 1968, the country economy became trade-dependent but richer than the rest of the Eastern Bloc. This began to put pressure on the regime as the world market fluctuations could make or break Hungary's economy. It also made it weak to changes in prices of Soviet-imported raw materials and energy resources. Hungary, being a resource-poor satellite of the USSR, was, for its politically-independent spirit, very dependent on Soviet imports. By the 1980s, Hungary began to suffer from inflation, which particularly hurt people on fixed incomes. Hungary ran a massive foreign debt, and poverty became widespread. By 1985, with political instability accompanying the economic instability, Kádár and the regime were forced to recognize the impending collapse of socialism in Hungary. At the same time, Hungary began to reduce border restrictions to the West which made other Eastern Bloc citizens easier to flee to the West, never to return."
 sov_fall.6.title:0 "The Crumbling Iron Curtain: Romania"
 sov_fall.6.desc:0 "After the Brașov rebellion in 1987, the seeds of revolution were sowed. Nicolae Ceauşescu started to be obsessed in the Juche ideology after a state visit to North Korea in 1974 which became extreme in the mid-1980s. Mass demolitions of historic buildings of both cultural and religious importance to Romania to build a palace of his dreams. This obsession also crippled the economy and liberties of the nation. Tourism quickly fell thanks to mass surveillance and a lack of places to visit. Due to this situation, income from tourism dropped substantially, the number of foreign tourists visiting Romania dropping by 75%, with the three main tour operators that organized trips in Romania leaving the country by 1987. By 1988, with perestroika and glasnost policies in effect in the Soviet Union and China undergoing economic reforms, Romania's Stalinist sociopolitical system began to look increasingly out-of-place, but all attempts were made to keep the populace isolated from events going on outside the country."
 sov_fall.7.title:0 "The Crumbling Iron Curtain: East Germany"
 sov_fall.7.desc:0 "Compared to the other Eastern Bloc nations, East Germany was close to the West due to the proximity of West Germany and West Berlin. The Basic Treaty between East and West Germany in 1972 sought to normalise contacts between the two governments. In September 1987, he became the first East German head of state to visit West Germany, where he was received with full state honours by West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in an act that seemed to confirm West Germany's acceptance of East Germany's existence. During this trip, he also journeyed to his birthplace in Saarland, where he held an emotional speech in which he spoke of a day when Germans would no longer be separated by borders. This trip had been planned twice before, including September 1984, but was initially blocked by the Soviet leadership which mistrusted the special East-West German relationship, particularly efforts to expand East Germany's limited independence in the realm of foreign policy. In the late 1980s, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev introduced glasnost and perestroika, reforms to liberalise the socialist planned economy. Frictions between him and Honecker had grown over these policies and numerous additional issues from 1985 onward. East Germany refused to implement similar reforms, with Honecker reportedly telling Gorbachev: We have done our perestroika; we have nothing to restructure."
