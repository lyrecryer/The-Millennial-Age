  #Agricultre
 gw_agriculture: "Great War Agriculture"
 gw_agriculture_desc: "The Great War has changed many aspect of agricultre. Not only by the tools but also the lack of it. As Horses was sent to the battlefields in their millions it made the Horse a rare sight in many parts of the countryside. As a result, farmers had to use other way to pull their ploughs."
 mechanized_agriculture: "Mechanized Agriculture"
 mechanized_agriculture_desc: "Tractors, Harvesters and various other techologies has appeared between 1918 and 1936. This allowed farms to grow beyound acres and start to become heacres instead. While horses or oxen was still used in various roles, it was clear that it was become replaced."
 agricultural_chemistry: "Agricultural Chemistry"
 agricultural_chemistry_desc: "Previously, Fertilizers,Insecticides,Herbicides and Fungicides was expensive to procure due to their raritey of ingreadients which was all natural. However, between 1937 and 1945 there was a drive to produce synthetic versions. This reduced both the cost and the materials required for agricultre. This step was considered to be the first step towards the Green Revolution."
 greenhouse_botany: "Greenhouse Botany"
 greenhouse_botany_desc: "During WW2 many nations tried to see how to grow crops all year round instead of the seasonal system of old. Soon the first modern Greenhouses began to appear with climate control and even artificial sunlight (through the use of UV lamps) to keep the crops growing no matter the time of year or weather. This helped grow crops that are hard to procure or lost in war."
 agricultural_production: "Agricultural Preservatives"
 agricultural_production_desc: "Soon after 1945, there was a massive drive to preserve the ever growing number of food that was being produced during WW2. While most of the technqies used was already been used, it wasn't done on an industrial scale till now. This step was considered to be the second step towards the Green Revolution."
 semi_modern_mechanization: "Semi Modern Mechanization"
 semi_modern_mechanization_desc: "Much like the First World War, the Second World War brought about major changes to the agricultural world. Tractors that could carry it's own Harvesters which later become known as the Combine Harvester appeared. Add the rise of Crop-Dusters (Airplanes modified to provide seeding and spraying various chemicals on crops) and soon farms now reached the sizes of Decares. This was considred to be the final step towards the Green Revolution."
 proto_green_revolution: "Proto Green Revolution"
 proto_green_revolution_desc: "Although there was no major improvements the results of the previous three changes of the Agricultural worlds has literly, begun to bear fruit. Across the world the amount of produce being created was growing at an expernatiol rate. Soon the full effect of this Green Revolution will appear. At the same time, processed food became easier to preserve and it can last for much longer than before. The concept of Fast Food has started to appear."
 early_green_revolution: "Early Green Revolution"
 early_green_revolution_desc: "The Green Revolution is starting to take effect. The World populations has begun to grow much faster than expected. Sustainable Agriculture,Pollination Management and way food is both stored and packages began to accceleate the Green Revolution to it's zenith."
 green_revolution: "The Green Revolution"
 green_revolution_desc: "The Green Revolution is the third Agricultural Revolution which the process and production of food has changed in such a way, it was almost impossible to return to old ways. Many areas of the globe once considred to be unfit for farming became suitable as the understanding of cemestry and biology advanced enough to hybridise plants to grow in such areas. The basic approach was the development of high-yielding varieties of cereal grains, expansion of irrigation infrastructure, modernization of management techniques, distribution of hybridized seeds, synthetic fertilizers, and pesticides to farmers."
 early_modern_agricultural_production: "Early Modern Agricultural Production"
 early_modern_agricultural_production_desc: "At this point, it was no longer as case of how much food to produce but how long food can last. In many areas, Vegetables and fruits rotted too quickly to be worth transporting across the world. Vegetables and fruit are now cleaned and sterilised within factories and warehouses without a single human present. As such there was no longer any chances of reinfections. This helped such produce to become viable to transport."
 early_biosphere: "Early Biosphere"
 early_biosphere_desc: "Unlike Greenhouses, Biospheres are designed to create an self contained ecosystem and envioment. This gives the opertuinity to not only grow crops but also raise animials as well. The walls are made out both plastic and glass in a octogagnial shape creating a otherworldly look to them. Or a golfball."
 diversified_agricultural_production: "Diversified Agricultural Production"
 diversified_agricultural_production_desc: "In the past, growing the same food every year was seen as a normal process but now that sheer intestive nature of modern day farming has crippled the soil ability to handle crops. Now synthetic chemicals and petro chemicals are being replaced by organic chemicals. Irrigation has changed to reduce water waste as well."
 advanced_diversified_agricultural_production: "Advanced Diversified Agricultural Production"
 advanced_diversified_agricultural_production_desc: "To add on from the previous changes made during the 1980's, the use of Pesticides have been restricted considerbly. With the rise of Robotics and automation, entire sectors of agriculture is becoming human free."
 new_age_farming: "New Age Farming"
 new_age_farming_desc: "During the 1980's onwards, people became aware of the envioment and how sythetic and unethical the agricultural industry became in the past 3 decades. Now people has started to favor organic and ethical farms which treated animals humanly. Slaughtering was now painless,produce was now grown locally rather than imported,Free Range farming became the next big thing. In a rather strange irony, the 21st centery farm is based on the farms of the 19th centery. Just with modern comforts."
 modern_biosphere: "Modern Biosphere"
 modern_biosphere_desc: "The modern Biosphere was a massive improvement compared to the Early Biosphere. It has now self serficcent allowing anything housed within to live without any major concern. The materials are now lighter and far more efficient in bringing light than before. Water systems are minimal to no waste, making it impossible to run out. Solar panels and other green energy allows to operate without the outside world. Many consider this to be the final frontier of Agriculture."
