 startup.2.desc_ENG:0 "The United Kingdom has a population of around 57,439,000 citizens and the Prime Minister Margret Thatcher has been in charge for 9 years. The country is slowly coming out of a ression with unemployment falling and housing prices starts to rise. The privatiation of various inferstructure and government ulititles help boost the ecomany. Margret Thatcher recently interdouced the Community Charge (A Poll Tax but in name.) and support for the Conservate party is starting to fall and with it Margret Thatcher's support within the party. If she doesn't act now then it is likely that she will be removed from power."
 startup.2.desc_SOV:0 "The Soviet Union is in big trouble. The Soviet Union expericend disaster after disaster. The failed Afghan War in 1988, Chernobyl in 1986 and the near apocliatic misunderstanding of Able Archer in 1983 has made the Soviet Union in a very shaky but still recoverable envioment. Mikhail Gorbachev's Glasnot (Increased freedom of speech and reduced the government control on the press.) and Perestroika (Increased the independance of various ministeries and adopting elements of liberal economics.) reforms made the country richer and more democratic but angred the old guard who belived that Gorbachev is betraying the Soviet Union principles. This only increased further with The Law on Cooperatives in May 1988 which allowed private ownership of businesses for the first time scince 1921. Will these reforms be the death knell of the USSR? or will it be a new USSR without equal? Time will tell."
